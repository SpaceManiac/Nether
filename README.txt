== ABOUT NETHER ==

Nether is a quick Bukkit plugin that makes portals function very similar to
single player. It uses no permissions, adds no commands, and has no other
features.

  - Walking through portals will search for a portal in the proper location
    in the other world, creating one if none is found.
  - Automatically created portals have a stone platform and an air pocket
    formed around them.
  - Dying in the Nether will respawn players in the normal world.

Nether is currently on version 1.1.
